                make online consulations, and receive digital prescriptions.
                In order for researchers to see how our system could be enchanced during the test run, the approach that
                we are
                going to apply to its features will be put to the tests, so that individuals can benefits from the
                technological
                advancement that will be made during the deployment of our system on the target location.
